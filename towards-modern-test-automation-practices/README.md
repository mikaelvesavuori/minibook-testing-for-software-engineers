# ðŸ¤– Towards modern testing practices

While the previous section was devoted to delivering competent software engineering, this section proposes directions to thinking and practically conducting our testing.

The approach we should follow is called **continuous testing**, something which Google describes in the following way:

> **The key to building quality into software is getting fast feedback on the impact of changes throughout the software delivery lifecycle**. Traditionally, teams relied on manual testing and code inspection to verify systems' correctness. These inspections and tests typically occurred in a separate phase after "dev complete." This approach has the following drawbacks \[...]
>
> Instead, teams should:
>
> * Perform all types of testing continuously throughout the software delivery lifecycle.
> * Create and curate fast, reliable suites of automated tests which are run as part of your continuous delivery pipelines.
>
> Not only does this help teams build (and learn how to build) high quality software faster, [DORA](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html)'s research shows that it also drives improved software stability, reduced team burnout, and lower deployment pain.

In this section, we will address many of the concerns and theoretical parts relating to testing in a modern technical environment and how to actively move towards working with them. Among some of the topics, you'll get to know:

* What types of testing exist
* Some of the testing models and how they compare to each other
* What goes into writing a good test
* Why conventional wisdom on testing environments and test data is wrong
* Why testing serverless isn't that different, if at all
