{% hint style="info" %}
There is no dedicated project for this book. We will instead use several existing projects as a base of reference.
{% endhint %}

As mentioned before, we will look at several applications and their source code in this book. They are all available at the respective links:

* [https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/get-a-room-ddd-example](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/get-a-room-ddd-example)
* [https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/testable-systems-starter](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/testable-systems-starter)
* [https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/microservices-testing-workshop](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/microservices-testing-workshop)
* [https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/acmecorp-microservices-webshop](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/acmecorp-microservices-webshop)
* [https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/better-apis-workshop](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/better-apis-workshop)

All of these are complete, detailed projects with the dedicated `testable-systems-starter` and `microservices-testing-workshop` even being adapted fully for a practical setting. I will describe commonalities among them in the next section.
